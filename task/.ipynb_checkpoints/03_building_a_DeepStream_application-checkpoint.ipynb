    "# Building a DeepStream Application #\n",
    "Now that we have established the fundamentals, we are ready to build a basic video AI application. DeepStream supports application development in C/C++ and in Python through [gst-python](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-python.html), the GStreamer framework’s Python bindings. To make it easier to get started, DeepStream ships withs several reference applications in both C/C++ and Python. These sample applications can be found in the [NVIDIA-AI-IOT](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_reference_apps) GitHub page. For this lab, we'll be using Python. The other methods for development include: \n",

    "* The [h264parse](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/videoparsersbad/h264parse.html) plugin is used to parse the input elementary H.264 stream into frame-size bytes of data. \n",
    "* The [nvv4l2decoder](https://gist.github.com/nins-k/6f7377629000894deedc7f14d7ef64fe) plugin decodes the input data using the appropriate codec, which is H.264 in this case.\n",
    "* The [nvstreammux](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_plugin_gst-nvstreammux.html) plugin is a required stream aggregator. This video aggregator helps in accepting `n` input streams and converts them into sequential batched frames. Even though our simple application only consumes one input stream, this plugin is required as `nvinfer` accepts _batched_ buffers with the `NvDsBatchMeta` structure already attached. \n",
    "    * This plugin takes `width`,  `height`, and `batch-size` as parameters. \n",
    "* The [nvinfer](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_plugin_gst-nvinfer.html) plugin performs transformation (format conversion and scaling) on the input frame based on network requirements and passes the transformed data to the low-level library. This is the plugin that we will use to define the deep learning task(s) associated with our application. The low-level library pre-processes the transformed frames (performs normalization and mean subtraction) and produces final float RGB/BGR/GRAY planar data which are passed to the TensorRT engine for inferencing. The output type generated by the low-level library depends on the network type. We will configure the `nvinfer` plugin for our `TrafficCamNet` object detection model. It attaches the inference results such as _object class(s)_, _bounding box coordinates_, _etc._, to the metadata.\n",

    "* The [fakesink](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/coreelements/fakesink.html) plugin acts as the end of the pipeline where the data flow ends. \n",
    "    * There is a synchronization-against-the-clock mechanism in GStreamer. For local video file, it is recommended to set the `sync` property to `1` to get smooth video playback, vs. `0` for live-sources such as IP camera since they give frames at a static rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "*More information about the plugins can be found in the [DeepStream Plugin Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/index.html#plugins-development-guide) and [GStreamer Plugin Guide](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins_doc.html).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will add a **callback function** on the source pad of the `nvinfer` plugin to access the metadata in the application. The application can then use this metadata to solve the given problem (in this case counting the number of cars, persons, road signs, and two-wheelers)."

    "### Probe to Metadata Access ###\n",
    "Recall that we use probes to access metadata, which are callback functions that interact with the pads of elements. To access the metadata, we can use the DeepStream Python bindings, `pyds`. DeepStream uses an extensible standard structure for metadata. The basic metadata structure `NvDsBatchMeta` starts with batch-level metadata, created inside the `Gst-nvstreammux` plugin (see below). The object-level metadata we are looking for is accessible through `NvDsBatchMeta` > `NvDsFrameMeta` > `NvDsObjectMeta`. Some metadata instances are stored in `GList` form, which requires the data to be casted to the appropriate structure using `pyds.NvDsFrameMeta.cast(data)` or  `pyds.NvDsObjectMeta.cast(data)`. The `NvDsObjectMeta` contains the inference results from the deep learning neural networks, depending on what the configurations are. \n",
    "<p><img src='images/DS_plugin_metadata.png' width=480></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We write the user-defined callback function `pgie_source_pad_buffer_probe`. Inside the function, we first get the batch metadata from the buffer with `pyds.gst_buffer_get_nvds_batch_meta(buffer)`. From there, we can iterate through all the metadata types that are attached to the buffer. The DeepStream plugins attach metadata of type `NVDS_META_FRAME_INFO` to the buffer. To achieve our goal, we access the object metadata to count the number of objects in each frame and print the bounding box coordindates. In this example we are using a 4-class-detectors (vehicle, person, two-wheeler, and road sign). The return value of the probe function is programmed to `Gst.PadProbeReturn.OK`, which is the normal probe return value and leaves the probe in place. There are other options for the [return value](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gst-1.0/enums.html#Gst.PadProbeReturn) that can be considered for more complex cases. "

    "The pipeline has a bus that we will use to monitor messages. We run a GLib/Gtk+ `MainLoop` (or iterate the default GLib main context regularly) and attach a watch/message handler to the bus with `Gst.Bus.add_signal_watch()`. This way the `GLib.Mainloop` will check the bus for new messages and notify. The message handler is also achieved through a callback function, which we define as `bus_call`. This handler will be called whenever the pipeline emits a message to the bus. The return value of the callback function should be `True` to keep it attached to the bus. Since this callback function for checking messages to the bus is used by many of the DeepStream applications, we refactor it into a [Python script](common/bus_call.py) (`./common/bus_call.py`) for ease of use. When we use `inpsect.getsource(object)` to look at the definition of the function, we find that it's a simple procedure that checks for the message type and handles them accordingly. With the message handler in place, we put the pipeline in the `PLAYING` state and run the `MainLoop`. Finally, when the pipeline is finished, we put the pipeline into the `NULL` state to clean up."

We can measure throughput with a probe to get a sense of the dataflow and express it as frames per second (FPS). Below we create another probe function to measure the time it takes for frames to pass through the `nvinfer` plugin. By taking the [reciprocal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal) of the time, we can approximate the frame rate. We're going to print out our frame rate for a single video stream, but we could expand this to generate metrics such as minimum, maximum, and average frame throughput at a granular level for each video stream.

    "### Latency with Debug Log ###\n",
    "**Latency** is the time difference between when data enter one element and into the next in the pipeline. In general, low latency is desirable and particularly important for real-time pipelines that are time-critical. In the context of video analytics, latency is the amount of time it takes for the input streams to be processed. Latency in a DeepStream pipeline can be measured using GStreamer debugging capabilities. The debug log is very useful but can be verbose. We specify the amount of desired output based on the below table (take from [GStreamer documentation](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/debugging-tools.html)). By setting the `GST-DEBUG` environment variable to `GST_SCHEDULING:7` when running the DeepStream pipeline, we get a `trace` log that contains details on when the buffers are processed. GStreamer allows for custom debugging information handlers, but the default one is very useful. When using the default handler, the content of each line in the debug output looks like the below and includes various information. "

This video aggregator helps in accepting `n` input streams and converts them into sequential batched frames. Even though our simple application only consumes one input stream, this plugin is required as `nvinfer` accepts _batched_ buffers with the `NvDsBatchMeta` structure already attached. \n",

This is the plugin that we will use to define the deep learning task(s) associated with our application. The low-level library pre-processes the transformed frames (performs normalization and mean subtraction) and produces final float RGB/BGR/GRAY planar data which are passed to the TensorRT engine for inferencing. The output type generated by the low-level library depends on the network type. We will configure the `nvinfer` plugin for our `TrafficCamNet` object detection model. It attaches the inference results such as _object class(s)_, _bounding box coordinates_, _etc._, to the metadata.\n",

    "### Starting the Pipeline ###\n",
    "The pipeline has a bus that we will use to monitor messages. We run a GLib/Gtk+ `MainLoop` (or iterate the default GLib main context regularly) and attach a watch/message handler to the bus with `Gst.Bus.add_signal_watch()`. This way the `GLib.Mainloop` will check the bus for new messages and notify us. The message handler is also achieved through a callback function, which we define as `bus_call`. This handler will be called whenever the pipeline emits a message to the bus. The return value of the callback function should be `True` to keep it attached to the bus. Since this callback function for checking messages to the bus is used by many of the DeepStream applications, we refactor it into a [Python script](common/bus_call.py) (`./common/bus_call.py`) for ease of use. When we use `inpsect.getsource(object)` to look at the definition of the function, we find that it's a simple procedure that checks for the message type and handles them accordingly. With the message handler in place, we put the pipeline in the `PLAYING` state and run the `MainLoop`. Finally, when the pipeline is finished, we put the pipeline into the `NULL` state to clean up."
